    <h2>ðŸš€ SRIL 2022 Planetary Exploration Challenge ðŸš€</h2>

    <p>
      On a distant planet, a rover awaits your command to begin exploration of a
      new planet's surface! SRIL's 2022 Planetary Exploration challenge hopes to
      explore some of the objectives, and challenges faced by space agencies
      when exploring the uncharted terrain of extraterrestrial bodies.

    <h2>ðŸš— 2021 SRIL Gravity Car Challenge ðŸš—</h2>

    <p>
      SRIL is proud to present the Gravity Car Challenge! Learn how to design
      and build a gravity car through our three workshops led by university STEM
      students, and put your newly learned skills to the test in our Final
      Gravity Car Race, where 20 team submissions will be 3D printed and
      competed on a racetrack. Register by yourself or with a team of friends to
      win $30 in gift cards for attending the workshops, with additional cash
      prizes available for the Final Challenge! We are also excited to host a
      workshop in August featuring a Co-op student working at Tesla, so be sure
      to attend and learn all about their experience.

    <h2>UBC Geering Up x SRIL: Robotics Today (All-Girls Grade 9)</h2>

    <p>
      One of the best ways to find out what you are passionate about is to try
      it out for yourself! In this event, you will be able to see a robot you
      have created come to life in a fun and interactive environment. Robotics
      Today will feature how to program robots in a virtual VEX Robotics
      simulator. This event will help you discover the many ways in which
      robotics can help our world.
